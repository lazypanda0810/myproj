## 📖 Study Tips

### Introduction to Java
- **JVM:** Runs Java bytecode
- **Creator:** James Gosling (1995)
- **Key Principle:** Write Once, Run Anywhere
- **Features:** OOP, Platform Independent, Secure

### Variables and Data Types

**Primitive Data Types:**
| Type | Size | Example |
|------|------|---------|
| byte | 1 byte | byte age = 20; |
| short | 2 bytes | short s = 150; |
| int | 4 bytes | int num = 500; |
| long | 8 bytes | long pop = 999999L; |
| float | 4 bytes | float price = 99.5f; |
| double | 8 bytes | double rate = 45.67; |
| char | 2 bytes | char grade = 'A'; |
| boolean | 1 bit | boolean flag = true; |

**Non-Primitive:** String, Arrays, Classes, Interfaces

**Variable Types:**
- **Local:** Inside methods
- **Instance:** Inside class, outside methods
- **Static:** Belongs to class, shared among objects

### Control Flow

**Conditional Statements:**
```java
// if-else
if (marks >= 40) {
    System.out.println("Pass");
} else {
    System.out.println("Fail");
}

// switch
switch(day) {
    case 1: System.out.println("Monday"); break;
    case 2: System.out.println("Tuesday"); break;
    default: System.out.println("Invalid");
}
```

**Loops:**
```java
// for loop
for(int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}

// while loop
while(i <= 5) {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
}

// do-while (executes at least once)
do {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
} while(i <= 5);
```

### OOP Concepts
- **extends:** For class inheritance
- **implements:** For interface implementation
- **main():** Entry point of Java program
- **new:** Create objects
- **Abstract class:** Can have method implementations
- **Interface:** Traditionally only method declarations

## 📝 Quick Reference

### Key Java Syntax
```java
// Hello World Program
public class Demo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}

// Variable Declaration
